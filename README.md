# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Retail

DATASET: Salessuperstore Database

DESCRIPTION: I'm excited to share my recent project focused on boosting retail profits through comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the 'SampleSuperstore' dataset [bit.ly/3i4rbWl]. Utilizing powerful tools like Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, I aimed to identify key areas for improvement within the retail sector. By examining sales trends, product categories, and regional performance, I uncovered significant business challenges such as low-selling regions, underperforming categories, and products with low-profit margins. This analysis provided actionable insights, enabling data-driven decisions to optimize marketing strategies and enhance profitability. ðŸ“ˆðŸ’¡
